## 🌱 What is Green-AI?

Green-AI is a lightweight utility for detecting and fixing energy-inefficient code patterns. Our mission is to help developers write sustainable software by identifying green software violations in real-time.

**Key Focus**: Energy efficiency, carbon emissions reduction, sustainable development.

---

## ✨ Features (v0.7.0)

### 📊 Code Scanning
- **Multi-language support**: Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, TypeScript
- **Tree-sitter AST parsing**: Accurate, language-agnostic code analysis
- **10+ detection rules**: Inefficient loops, unnecessary computations, resource leaks, etc.

### ⚡ Dual-Metric Emissions Tracking
- **Scanning emissions**: Real-time energy cost of analysis (CodeCarbon)
- **Codebase emissions**: Estimated energy cost of running the code
- **Per-issue breakdown**: Energy impact of each violation

### 🎯 Analysis Engine
- **Complexity metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, loop iterations
- **Energy modeling**: Baseline + multipliers for code patterns
- **Severity scoring**: Low, Medium, High risk levels

### 🖥️ Web Dashboard

## 🤝 Contributing

Green-AI is an open-source project focused on sustainable software. We welcome contributions!

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
5. Maintain >80% code coverage
6. Submit a pull request

### Development Workflow
- All **output files go to `output/` folder** (CSV, HTML, emissions)
- Only **backlog.md** and **release-notes.md** in docs/ folder
- Write docstrings for all functions
- Add tests for new features
- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations
- Import modules: `from src.core.xxx import`

### Repository Standards

#### Directory Organization
```
green-ai-agent/
├── src/                      # Source code (all modules)
├── tests/                    # Test files (pytest)
├── rules/                    # YAML rule definitions
├── docs/                     # Documentation (backlog, release-notes, vision, standards)
├── output/                   # ALL generated reports (CSV, HTML, emissions, logs)
├── data/                     # Data files (CSVs from scanning)
└── [root files]              # Only: README.md, requirements.txt, config files
```

#### Code Patterns

**Output Files** - Always use output/ folder:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Uses output folder
from src.core.export import CSVExporter
exporter = CSVExporter()  # Defaults to output/green-ai-report.csv

# ❌ WRONG - Creates file in root
exporter = CSVExporter('green-ai-report.csv')
```

**Path Handling** - Use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
from pathlib import Path
output_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / 'output'
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# ❌ WRONG - String paths, platform-specific
output_file = 'output\\report.csv'
```

**Imports** - Always use src module pattern:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
from src.core.export import CSVExporter
from src.core.scanner import Scanner

# ❌ WRONG
from export import CSVExporter
```

**Logging** - All logs to output/logs/:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Logs to output/logs/
import logging
from pathlib import Path
logs_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / 'output' / 'logs'
logs_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
handler = logging.FileHandler(logs_dir / 'app.log')

# ❌ WRONG - Logging to root
handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log')
```

#### Standards Summary
- **Output files**: CSV, HTML, emissions → `output/` folder only
- **Documentation**: Only backlog.md, release-notes.md, vision.md, development-standards.md in `docs/`
- **Code style**: PEP 8 + type hints
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 80%, target 85%+
- **Imports**: Always `from src.module import` pattern
- **Logs**: All to `output/logs/` (pytest, Flask, CLI)
- **Paths**: Use `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform compatibility

#### GitHub Copilot Integration
When generating code, constrain with:
- "Save results to output/ folder"
- "Update docs/backlog.md with..."
- "Use pathlib.Path for file operations"
- "All logs should go to output/logs/"

## 🚫 Copilot & File Creation Policy

> **STRICT RULE:** No new files or folders may be created in this repository by Copilot or any automated tool without explicit USER permission. All documentation, code, and configuration changes must be reviewed and approved by a human user. Any attempt to auto-generate files, markdowns, or logs outside the approved structure will be rejected.

- All outputs must go to the `output/` folder.
- Only `BACKLOG.md`, `release-notes.md`, `vision.md`, and `development-standards.md` are allowed in `docs/`.
- No new markdown or config files may be created in any folder unless approved by the USER.
- All code, test, and rule files must follow the structure in this README.
- Any violation of this policy will be reverted.

---

## 🧹 Maintenance & Folder Policy

- All cache, build, and temporary folders (e.g., `.pytest_cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `data/`) are deleted as part of regular maintenance and must not be committed or recreated.
- Only the following folders are allowed at the top level: `src/`, `tests/`, `rules/`, `docs/`, `output/`, `.github/`.
- All module documentation should be merged into the main README unless it is essential for developer onboarding or rule explanation.
- If a file or folder is not referenced in code or documentation, it will be deleted.
